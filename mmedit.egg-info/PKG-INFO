## News
- 2 Dec 2021: Colab demo released <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I0kZMM0DQyb4ueHZw5si8fMnRCJ_eUX3?usp=sharing"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="google colab logo"></a>
- 18 Apr 2022: Code released. Also merged into [MMEditing](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting)
- 5 Feb 2023: The checkpoints for **BasicVSR_2x** is released. 

## TODO
- [ ] Add BasicVSR_2x architecture
- [x] ~~Add BasicVSR_2x checkpoints~~
- [ ] Add data processing scripts
- [x] ~~Add checkpoints for deblur and denoise~~
- [x] ~~Add configs for deblur and denoise~~
- [x] ~~Add Colab demo~~

## Pre-trained Weights
You can find the pre-trained weights for **deblurring** and **denoising** in this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gopo637rbutlxde/AACGnXDlvQMjwfCey3m2g34za?dl=0). For **super-resolution** and **compressed video enhancement**, please refer to [MMEditing](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting/tree/master/configs/restorers/basicvsr_plusplus).

## Installation
1. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
2. `pip install openmim`
3. `mim install mmcv-full`
4. `git clone https://github.com/ckkelvinchan/BasicVSR_PlusPlus.git`
5. `cd BasicVSR_PlusPlus`
6. `pip install -v -e .`

## Inference a Video
1. Download pre-trained weights
2. `python demo/restoration_video_demo.py ${CONFIG} ${CHKPT} ${IN_PATH} ${OUT_PATH}`

For example, you can download the VSR checkpoint [here](https://download.openmmlab.com/mmediting/restorers/basicvsr_plusplus/basicvsr_plusplus_c64n7_8x1_600k_reds4_20210217-db622b2f.pth) to `chkpts/basicvsr_plusplus_reds4.pth`, then run
```
python demo/restoration_video_demo.py configs/basicvsr_plusplus_reds4.py chkpts/basicvsr_plusplus_reds4.pth data/demo_000 results/demo_000
```
You can also replace `${IN_PATH} ${OUT_PATH}` by your video path (e.g., `xxx/yyy.mp4`) to input/output videos.

## Training Models
1. Put the dataset in the designated locations specified in the configuration file.
2. `sh tools/dist_train.sh ${CONFIG} ${NGPUS}`

## Data Preprocessing
To be added...
